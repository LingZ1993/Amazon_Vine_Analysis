# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The main purpose of this project is to analyze reviews posted by members of the Amazon Vine, which is a program, according to Amazon, 'was created to provide customers with more information including honest and unbiased feedback from some of Amazon's most trusted reviewers.' 
In this analysis, I used PySpark to extract the data, connected to AWS RDS, and load the data into pgAdmin.
