# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The main purpose of this project is to analyze reviews posted by members of the Amazon Vine, which is a program, according to Amazon, 'was created to provide customers with more information including honest and unbiased feedback from some of Amazon's most trusted reviewers.' That way we can see the difference between vine reviewers and non-vine reviewers, and answering questions that are relative to this analysis assignment. 
In this analysis, I used PySpark to extract the data, connected to AWS RDS, and load the data into pgAdmin. Among the list of the dataset I choose to review the video games review dataset, and to see how many reviewers are vine members, how many 5 stars are posted by vine reviewers. 

## Results
### Answering the following questions:
